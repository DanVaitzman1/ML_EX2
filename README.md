# Titanic Dataset Classification and Gradient Descent Optimization

## Description :

This repository contains Python code for performing classification on the Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived using logistic regression and decision trees.
It also includes an optimization example using gradient descent to find the local minimum of a given function.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas 1.x
- NumPy 1.x
- Scikit-learn 0.24

## Data Source
The Titanic dataset is sourced from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DanVaitzman1/ML_EX2/main/Titanic.csv).
The dataset includes 1309 passengers with nine attributes.
